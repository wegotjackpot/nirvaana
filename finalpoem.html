  <h1>you.</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    <span>If I were a star, <br> and you were a star, <br> I’d blink at you, wink at you, twinkle at you — <br> and the world would call it science.</span>

    <span>But I would know, <br> it’s us.</span>

    <span>I adore the texture of your mind, <br> how your thoughts unfold like constellations, <br> quiet, infinite, and full of wonder.</span>

    <span>The perfume of your soul stays in the room, <br> like rain on parched earth, <br> soft, stubborn, unforgettable.</span>

    <span>Your face is my chosen abyss. <br> I could fall into it a thousand times <br> and never want to be found.</span>

    <span>Your lips taste like honey, <br> your eyes burn like wildfire, <br> and I, like a fool, <br> keep walking into the flame.</span>

    <span>Looking at you makes me forget <br> how to exist in the world properly. <br> You turn me into this clumsy, wide-eyed child — <br> counting the seconds between your glances, <br> hoarding your smiles like treasure, <br> memorizing the shape of your laugh.</span>

    <span>when you are yourself, <br> I watch like it’s art. <br> When you laugh your heart out — <br> I forget what sadness feels like.</span>

    <span>When I catch you off guard, <br> and your ears flush before your cheeks, <br> my heart writes novels in the span of a heartbeat.</span>

    <span>On days the world is too loud, <br> too sharp, <br> too much, <br> I look at you.</span>

    <span>And you become the silence between songs, <br> the warmth before the rain, <br> the pause in a perfect sentence.</span>

    <span>you become the gentle patter of raindrops on a window, <br> you are the rain-soaked evening, <br> wrapping me in its quiet, <br> in its cool embrace.</span>

    <span>and you become the hope that lives <br> between today and all my tomorrows.</span>

    <span>and if the sky ever forgets <br> how to hold stars, <br> or the rain forgets how to fall,</span>

    <span>i will still remember <br> how you made my world feel <br> like poetry —</span>

    <span>and I will keep loving you <br> in the spaces <br> where words run out.</span>

    <span>In silence, <br> in stardust, <br> in everything.</span>
